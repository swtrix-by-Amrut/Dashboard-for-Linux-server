# Dashboard-for-Linux-server
A lightweight **Flask-based web tool** for quick and safe local linux server management  - without needing to enter terminal <br> Inspired by [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/), but intentionally **trimmed down** to limited features.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a **simple web interface** to perform everyday tasks like:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Power Control | Shutdown / Reboot buttons |
| Storage view | View disk space usage across multiple drives |
| USB Management | Mount / Unmount USB drives with one click |
| Shortcuts (1) | Run commands to manage services , provided as buttons |
| Shortcuts (2) | Quick links to  services running on the server  |

Built using:
- 🐍 **Python & Flask library** for backend logic  
- 🌐 **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** for frontend presentation

## 💡 Motivation

The [Cockpit project](https://cockpit-project.org/) is excellent, but in some cases:
- It exposes **too many system-level features** in admin mode,  
- A single misclick can trigger **irreversible damage**, and  
- It’s **overkill** when you just want basic local management.

This project basically reinvents the wheel, but in my method and added to my learning <br> 
It gives just enough functionality for quick system checks and controls without the overhead or risk.

### Limitations
- Only works for local server
- Only single user is supported at this time (i.e. the admin)
- Non-admin mode not  supported (like cockpit)
- no terminal support in web interface
